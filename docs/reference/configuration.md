# Configuration

## Plugin config (`openclaw.json`)

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "openclaw-amem": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "agentId": "main",
          "topK": 5
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Options

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `agentId` | `string` | `"main"` | Agent namespace for memory isolation. Notes from different agents are stored separately in Qdrant. |
| `topK` | `number` | `5` | Maximum memories returned by `memory_search`. |
| `agents` | `Record<string, {agentId?, collection?}>` | `{}` | Per-agent overrides. Set `collection` for Mode B physical isolation. |
| `llmProvider` | `"anthropic" \| "openai"` | `"anthropic"` | Request format for the engine's own LLM calls. See [LLM settings](#llm-settings) below. |
| `llmModel` | `string` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` (anthropic) · `gpt-4o-mini` (openai) | Model used for note construction, linking and evolution. |
| `llmBaseURL` | `string` | provider default | Endpoint for LLM calls, e.g. an OpenAI-compatible gateway. |
| `llmStrongProvider` | `string` | falls back to `llmProvider` | Optional strong tier: request format. |
| `llmStrongModel` | `string` | falls back to `llmModel` | Optional strong tier: model for the hard judgements. Unset = single-model behaviour. |
| `llmStrongBaseURL` | `string` | falls back to `llmBaseURL` | Optional strong tier: endpoint. |
| `llmCrudRole` | `"fast" \| "strong"` | `"fast"` | Which tier the `agent_end` CRUD decision runs on. |
| `crudUpdateMinSim` | `number` | `0.35` | Similarity floor for accepting an LLM-chosen `UPDATE` target. See [CRUD update safety](#crud-update-safety). |
| `hooks.allowConversationAccess` | `boolean` | `false` | Required for `agent_end` hook access. Set under `plugins.entries.openclaw-amem.hooks`, not under `config`. Without this, automatic memory write-back is silently blocked by OpenClaw. |

### CRUD update safety

When the `agent_end` hook decides an existing memory should be **updated**, it
picks one from a numbered list of candidates. Picking the wrong number is the
one write-path mistake that is both silent and destructive: the index is valid,
the note is usually one you own, so nothing structural catches it — and the
update overwrites that memory's text in place.

Two guards, both on by default:

- Before overwriting, the engine checks the replacement text is plausibly *about*
  the memory it is replacing (cosine similarity ≥ `crudUpdateMinSim`). If not, the
  fact is stored as a **new** memory instead. Nothing is lost either way —
  scheduled consolidation can merge a duplicate later, but it cannot resurrect an
  overwritten note.
- The replaced text is kept in the note's `evolution_history` (`action:
  "crud_update"`), so even an accepted overwrite stays recoverable.

`crudUpdateMinSim` is a heuristic, not a tuned constant. It sits just above the
`0.3` bar the engine uses for "related at all", because a legitimate update is
often a correction ("drinks tea" → "switched to coffee") that is related but not
near-identical. **Raise it when running a cheaper or smaller model** — those are
likelier to mis-pick, and the cost of being strict is a duplicate rather than a
destroyed memory.

### Contradiction sweep

The per-turn CRUD decision runs on the fast model. That is safe — the update
guard stops it writing to the wrong memory — but **dull**: it misses
contradictions it should have caught. A cheap model scores around 8.7% at
noticing that a stored memory has quietly stopped being true.

So a sweep runs offline, in batches, on the **strong** tier. It hands the model a
whole batch of memories at once rather than comparing them pairwise, because the
contradictions that matter are often *far apart* in meaning — "is vegetarian" and
"loved the steak" would never be paired by a similarity check. When it finds a
pair, it marks **both** notes with a pointer to the other and the reason, so the
conflict can be reviewed as **one decision** rather than two disconnected entries.

| `AMEM_CONFLICT_MODE` | What happens |
| :--- | :--- |
| `review` *(default)* | Both notes are flagged and appear in the quality review batch. Nothing is removed. You decide. |
| `auto` | As above, **and** the older note of each pair is retired automatically. |

::: danger Read this before enabling `auto`
Even a strong model is only around **55%** accurate at spotting implicit
contradictions. In `auto` mode that means roughly **two in five retirements will
silence a memory that was still true**.

The retirement is a soft delete — the note and its text survive and can be
restored — but for a system answering in real time, "recoverable" only helps once
somebody notices. `review` is the default for this reason.
:::

### Choosing models: a fast one and (optionally) a strong one

amem splits its own LLM calls into two tiers, because they are not equally hard:

| Tier | What runs on it | What to configure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **fast** | Almost everything: extracting keywords and tags, judging whether two notes link, refreshing a note's context, and the per-turn CRUD decision | **A cheap, fast model.** Local models are fine — this is the high-frequency path |
| **strong** | Only the genuinely hard judgements: deciding whether two memories should merge, and classifying whether new information contradicts what is stored | **A more capable model** — or nothing at all |

**If you configure only one model, everything runs on it.** That is the default and
it works. The `strong` tier is opt-in: leave it unset and `strong` simply *is*
`fast`, exactly as before.

Why the split: for extraction, a cheap model scores within ~2 points of a strong
one — but for spotting that a new fact *contradicts* a stored one, the gap is
large. So it is worth paying for a better model on the handful of calls that
actually need it, and not on the thousands that do not. The reasoning and the
evidence are in [Design Rationale](/guide/design-rationale).

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "openclaw-amem": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "llmProvider": "openai",
          "llmModel": "gpt-4o-mini",

          "llmStrongModel": "gpt-4o"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Each `strong` field falls back to its `fast` counterpart **individually**, which
makes all three useful shapes work:

- **Same provider, better model** — set only `llmStrongModel`. Most common.
- **Two different backends** — set all three `llmStrong*` fields. This is how you
  run a local Ollama for the fast tier and a hosted API for the strong one.
- **One model for everything** — set none of them.

::: tip Which model is "fast enough"?
Any competent instruction-following model that reliably returns JSON. `gpt-4o-mini`,
`claude-haiku`, `gemini-flash`, `deepseek-chat` and comparable local models are all
in range. amem does not need a reasoning model here, and reasoning models can
actually do *worse* inside a fixed pipeline like this one.
:::

::: warning There is no built-in strong default
If you do not set a `strong` model, amem will not silently pick a pricier one for
you. You have to ask for it.
:::

### LLM settings

The engine makes its own small LLM calls — extracting keywords and tags, judging
whether two notes should link, evolving a neighbourhood. You can point those at a
different model or endpoint than the one your agent session uses:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "openclaw-amem": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "llmProvider": "openai",
          "llmModel": "gpt-4o-mini",
          "llmBaseURL": "http://localhost:11434/v1"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Precedence**, highest first:

1. the environment variable (`AMEM_LLM_PROVIDER`, `AMEM_LLM_MODEL`, `AMEM_LLM_BASE_URL`)
2. the plugin config keys above
3. the built-in default for the provider

An environment variable set to an empty string counts as unset, so it cannot
silently shadow your config.

> **API keys are not configurable here, by design.** Keys are read from the
> environment only (`AMEM_LLM_API_KEY`, or the provider's own variable). A key
> field in `openclaw.json` would make the memory engine a channel for your
> credentials; endpoint and model are enough to route a call.

These are explicit settings — the engine does **not** currently follow whichever
model your agent session is using. That is deliberate: these are cheap,
high-frequency utility calls, and inheriting a large reasoning model would make
every memory write slow and expensive.

### Per-agent configuration (`agents`)

Each agent can override its `agentId` and optionally use a dedicated Qdrant collection (Mode B physical isolation):

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "openclaw-amem": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "agentId": "main",
          "topK": 5,
          "agents": {
            "dev": {
              "agentId": "dev"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For full physical isolation (Mode B), add a `collection` field:

```json
"agents": {
  "dev": {
    "agentId": "dev",
    "collection": "amem_notes_dev"
  }
}
```

See [Agent Isolation](/guide/agent-isolation) for a full explanation of Mode A vs Mode B.

## Environment variables

These environment variables override plugin defaults at runtime. Useful for testing or scripting without modifying config files.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AMEM_LLM_PROVIDER` | `anthropic` | Request format for LLM calls. `anthropic` uses the native Messages API; `openai` uses the Chat Completions API, which every OpenAI-compatible endpoint speaks (OpenAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Groq, Together, Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio…). |
| `AMEM_LLM_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` (anthropic) · `gpt-4o-mini` (openai) | LLM model used for note construction, CRUD decisions, link judgment, and memory evolution. Set to a cheaper model when running smoke tests to avoid consuming production quota. |
| `AMEM_LLM_STRONG_PROVIDER` | falls back to `AMEM_LLM_PROVIDER` | Optional strong tier: request format. See [Choosing models](#choosing-models-a-fast-one-and-optionally-a-strong-one). |
| `AMEM_LLM_STRONG_MODEL` | falls back to `AMEM_LLM_MODEL` | Optional strong tier: model for merge adjudication and contradiction classification. Unset = everything runs on the fast model. |
| `AMEM_LLM_STRONG_BASE_URL` | falls back to `AMEM_LLM_BASE_URL` | Optional strong tier: endpoint. Set all three to run the tiers on different backends. |
| `AMEM_CONFLICT_MODE` | `review` | What the contradiction sweep does with a pair it finds: `review` (mark only) or `auto` (also retire the older one). See [Contradiction sweep](#contradiction-sweep). |
| `AMEM_LLM_CRUD_ROLE` | `fast` | Which tier the `agent_end` CRUD decision uses (`fast` or `strong`). |
| `AMEM_LLM_BASE_URL` | provider default | Override the SDK base URL. Point it at your OpenAI-compatible gateway (with `AMEM_LLM_PROVIDER=openai`) or an Anthropic proxy. |
| `AMEM_LLM_API_KEY` | provider env | Override the API key. If unset, the Anthropic path falls back to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and the OpenAI path to `OPENAI_API_KEY`; if neither is set, the OpenAI path sends a placeholder so keyless local servers (Ollama, vLLM) work. |
| `AMEM_LLM_TIMEOUT` | `30000` | Per-request timeout in milliseconds for the LLM client. Guards against a slow or stuck endpoint (a loaded vLLM, an unreachable gateway) hanging the whole memory-write pipeline. |
| `AMEM_CRUD_UPDATE_MIN_SIM` | `0.35` | Similarity floor (0–1) for accepting an LLM-chosen CRUD `UPDATE` target. See [CRUD update safety](#crud-update-safety). |
| `AMEM_COLLECTION` | `amem_notes` | Qdrant collection name. Override to use a separate collection for testing. |
| `AMEM_REVIEW_DIR` | `process.cwd()` | Output directory for quality review batch files. |
| `AMEM_EVO_COUNTER_PATH` | `~/.openclaw/amem_evo_cnt.json` | File path for the evolution throttle counter. |
| `AMEM_PROMPT_LOCALE` | `en` | Prompt language for memory CRUD, merge, and evolution functions. Set to `zh` for Chinese prompts (better for Chinese-primary users). |

> `AMEM_DATA_DIR` (the engine's on-disk location for the evolution counter and consolidation logs) is read by the engine but **fixed to `~/.openclaw` by the plugin**, so setting it has no effect when running as the OpenClaw plugin — it applies only when using [`@heichaowo/amem-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@heichaowo/amem-core) directly.

### Example: run smoke test with Gemini

```bash
AMEM_LLM_MODEL=gemini-3.5-flash-low node run_smoketest.mjs
```

## LLM requirements

By default the engine uses the **Anthropic SDK** against `https://api.anthropic.com`. Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or `AMEM_LLM_API_KEY`) to authenticate, and `AMEM_LLM_BASE_URL` to point at an Anthropic-compatible proxy.

To use an **OpenAI-compatible** provider instead, set `AMEM_LLM_PROVIDER=openai` and point `AMEM_LLM_BASE_URL` at its endpoint. This covers OpenAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Groq, Together, and local servers (Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio). Reasoning models (`o1`, `o3`, `gpt-5`) are handled automatically.

```bash
# Example: DeepSeek
AMEM_LLM_PROVIDER=openai \
AMEM_LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com/v1 \
AMEM_LLM_API_KEY=sk-... \
AMEM_LLM_MODEL=deepseek-chat node run_smoketest.mjs

# Example: local Ollama (no key needed)
AMEM_LLM_PROVIDER=openai \
AMEM_LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1 \
AMEM_LLM_MODEL=qwen2.5 node run_smoketest.mjs
```

Recommended models:

| Use case | Model |
|----------|-------|
| Production (Anthropic) | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| Production (OpenAI-compatible) | `gpt-4o-mini`, `deepseek-chat` |
| Testing / smoke | `gemini-3.5-flash-low` |

## Qdrant collection schema

The plugin auto-creates the Qdrant collection on first run with:

- **Vector size**: 384 (multilingual-e5-small)
- **Distance**: Cosine
- **Payload fields**: `id`, `content`, `keywords`, `tags`, `context`, `category`, `links`, `retrieval_count`, `last_accessed`, `is_active`, `agent_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `owner`, `readers`, `writers`
