# Agent Isolation

openclaw-amem gives every OpenClaw agent its own private memory namespace. This page explains how isolation works, how shared memory is published, what the access fields mean, how to configure Mode A vs Mode B, and what the security and architectural rationale is.

---

## Introduction

In a multi-agent OpenClaw setup — for example, `main` (your daily driver) and `dev` (a sandboxed coding assistant) — each agent accumulates memories about its own work context. Without isolation, memories from `main` would pollute `dev`'s retrieval results and vice versa. More critically, a compromised or misbehaving agent could read private information stored by another agent through shared memory poisoning ([arXiv:2604.16548](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.16548)).

openclaw-amem addresses this with an **isolation-by-default** model: every memory written by an agent is private to that agent unless explicitly published to the `shared` scope.

### Research background

The design is informed by:

- **[arXiv:2604.16548]** — *Security of Long-Term Memory in LLM Agents* (2026): Memory leakage in multi-agent systems most commonly occurs via shared memory stores. The paper argues isolation should be the **default**, with sharing as an explicit, auditable exception.
- **[arXiv:2603.10062]** — *Multi-Agent Memory from a Computer Architecture Perspective* (2026): Models agent memory as an analogy to computer memory hierarchy — L1 cache (private), RAM (shared), NUMA (distributed). amem's Mode A maps to the L1/RAM split; Mode B maps to NUMA.
- **[arXiv:2504.19413]** — *Mem0: Building Production-Ready AI Agents with Scalable Long-Term Memory*, ECAI 2025: Defines a four-dimensional scope model (user_id, agent_id, run_id, app_id). amem's scope model is a deliberate subset — see [Comparison with mem0](#comparison-with-mem0-scope-model).

---

## Core concepts

### Private memory

Private memory is the default. When an agent writes a note, it is tagged with that agent's `agent_id` and a `readers` list containing only that agent. No other agent can retrieve it.

**When to use private memory:** Always, unless you have a specific reason to share. Private memory is appropriate for:
- Personal task context (`"Currently debugging auth middleware, focus on JWT expiry"`)
- Agent-specific preferences and conventions
- Sensitive or proprietary information
- Work-in-progress notes not ready to share

### Shared memory

Shared memory is written with `agent_id="shared"` and `readers=["*"]`. All agents that query memory will see shared notes mixed into their results.

**When to use shared memory:** When information is genuinely useful to all agents:
- Team-wide conventions (`"All API endpoints use snake_case JSON keys"`)
- Shared credentials or configuration facts
- Cross-agent context that needs to be consistent (`"Production deploy is frozen until 2026-06-20"`)

The key design decision: amem uses an **explicit** `agent_id="shared"` marker rather than relying on the absence of an `agent_id` field. This makes shared notes immediately identifiable in the Qdrant database and prevents accidental leakage via missing fields. See [Design rationale](#why-explicit-shared-marker) below.

### The three access fields

Every `MemoryNote` carries three access control fields:

| Field | Type | Example | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `owner` | `string` | `"main"` | The agent that originally wrote this note. Immutable after creation. |
| `readers` | `string[]` | `["main"]` or `["*"]` | Which agents can retrieve this note. `["*"]` means all agents. |
| `writers` | `string[]` | `["main"]` | Which agents can modify this note. **Not yet enforced** — Story 33. |

#### `owner`

The `owner` field records which agent created the note. It is set at write time and never modified, even if the note is later evolved or updated. It provides an audit trail: you can always query Qdrant to see which agent produced which memories.

Example: A note written by `dev` always has `owner: "dev"`, even if `main` later reads it via shared access.

#### `readers`

The `readers` field controls which agents' `searchMemory` calls will return this note.

```ts
// Private note — only "main" can retrieve it
readers: ["main"]

// Shared note — any agent can retrieve it
readers: ["*"]

// Future: fine-grained ACL (not yet implemented)
readers: ["main", "dev"]
```

In Mode A (shared collection), the `searchMemory` query adds a Qdrant filter:
```
agent_id IN ["<self>", "shared"]
```

This means each agent sees only its own private notes plus notes in the shared scope.

#### `writers`

The `writers` field records which agents are authorized to modify (evolve, update, soft-delete) this note. Currently **schema-only**: the field is stored in Qdrant but not checked at write time. Enforcement is planned for Story 33.

Example: A shared note written by `main` has `writers: ["main"]`, signaling intent that only `main` should modify it — but `dev` can currently update it without a hard error. This will change in Story 33.

### Why explicit shared marker?

mem0 ([arXiv:2504.19413]) uses an implicit convention: omitting `agent_id` from a memory entry means it is accessible to all agents. This creates a footgun — a bug that forgets to set `agent_id` accidentally creates a shared (leaky) memory.

amem uses `agent_id="shared"` as an explicit, deliberate opt-in. The consequence:

- You can `grep` or query Qdrant for `agent_id = "shared"` to audit all shared notes at any time
- A bug that fails to set `agent_id` falls back to the empty-string or missing-field case, which is **not** treated as shared — it is treated as a malformed write and rejected or stored as private
- Shared notes are visually distinct in Qdrant's web UI

---

## Mode A vs Mode B

openclaw-amem supports two physical isolation modes:

| Dimension | Mode A (default) | Mode B (dedicated collection) |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Qdrant collections | One (`amem_notes`) | One per agent (`amem_notes_dev`, etc.) |
| Isolation mechanism | `agent_id` payload filter at query time | Separate Qdrant collection |
| Shared notes | `agent_id="shared"` in same collection, visible to all agents | No cross-collection sharing — shared scope not visible in Mode B |
| Setup complexity | None (default) | Requires `collection` field in agent config |
| Index efficiency | Single index, filter overhead | Separate indexes, no filter overhead |
| Cross-agent sharing | Supported via `agent_id="shared"` | Not supported across agents |
| Physical data separation | Logical only | Complete (different Qdrant namespaces) |
| Recommended for | Most use cases | High-security sandboxing, compliance requirements |

### When to use Mode A

Mode A is the right choice for:
- Standard multi-agent setups where agents share some context
- Cases where you want shared notes visible to all agents
- Simpler configuration and operational overhead

### When to use Mode B

Mode B is appropriate when:
- You need **complete** physical separation (e.g., compliance or audit requirements)
- The `dev` agent must be fully sandboxed and must never see any `main` notes, even shared ones
- You want separate Qdrant collections for independent backup or restore

**Note:** In Mode B, shared notes written by `main` are NOT visible to `dev`. If you need cross-agent sharing, use Mode A.

---

## Configuration

### Mode A — default, no extra config required

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "allow": ["openclaw-amem"],
    "entries": {
      "openclaw-amem": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "agentId": "main",
          "topK": 5
        }
      }
    },
    "slots": {
      "memory": "openclaw-amem"
    }
  }
}
```

All agents use the default `amem_notes` collection. The `agentId` field determines which agent's notes are private. Shared notes (`agent_id="shared"`) are visible to all agents via automatic filter inclusion.

### Mode B — dedicated collection per agent

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "allow": ["openclaw-amem"],
    "entries": {
      "openclaw-amem": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "agentId": "main",
          "topK": 5,
          "agents": {
            "dev": {
              "agentId": "dev",
              "collection": "amem_notes_dev"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "slots": {
      "memory": "openclaw-amem"
    }
  }
}
```

When the `dev` agent is active, it reads from and writes to `amem_notes_dev` exclusively. The `main` agent continues to use `amem_notes`. No cross-collection queries are made.

### Full `openclaw.json` example with multiple agents

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "allow": ["openclaw-amem"],
    "entries": {
      "openclaw-amem": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "agentId": "main",
          "topK": 5,
          "agents": {
            "dev": {
              "agentId": "dev"
            },
            "sandbox": {
              "agentId": "sandbox",
              "collection": "amem_notes_sandbox"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "slots": {
      "memory": "openclaw-amem"
    }
  }
}
```

In this example:
- `main` — uses default `amem_notes` collection, Mode A
- `dev` — uses default `amem_notes` collection with `agent_id="dev"` filter, Mode A (shares the collection with `main`, can see shared notes)
- `sandbox` — uses dedicated `amem_notes_sandbox` collection, Mode B (completely isolated, no shared notes visible)

---

## How shared memory works step by step

### Writing a private note (default)

When `main` calls `memory_add("vendor account")`:

1. The plugin constructs a `MemoryNote` with:
   - `agent_id: "main"`
   - `owner: "main"`
   - `readers: ["main"]`
   - `writers: ["main"]`
2. The note is stored in Qdrant under `amem_notes` (Mode A) or `amem_notes_main` (if Mode B configured).
3. When `dev` calls `memory_search("vendor account")`, the query filter `agent_id IN ["dev", "shared"]` excludes this note — `dev` never sees it.

### Writing a shared note

Currently, shared notes are written via the internal `agent_id="shared"` scope parameter. A future user-facing API (e.g., `memory_add(text, scope="shared")`) is planned.

When a shared note is written:
1. `agent_id: "shared"`, `owner: "<writing agent>"`, `readers: ["*"]`, `writers: ["<writing agent>"]`
2. Stored in Qdrant in the shared collection (`amem_notes`).
3. All agents' `searchMemory` calls include `agent_id IN [self, "shared"]`, so all agents retrieve this note.

### How `searchMemory` filters results (Mode A)

Every `searchMemory` query in Mode A appends a Qdrant payload filter:

```
must: [
  { key: "is_active", match: { value: true } },
  { key: "agent_id", match: { any: ["<self>", "shared"] } }
]
```

This ensures:
- Soft-deleted notes (`is_active: false`) are always excluded
- Only the calling agent's private notes and globally shared notes are returned

### Mode B search (own collection only)

In Mode B, the plugin targets the agent's dedicated collection directly. No `agent_id` filter is needed — the collection itself provides isolation. Shared notes from other agents' collections are not queried.

---

## Consolidation behavior

### Per-agent scoping

The daily consolidation pass (02:30 AM in-process scheduler) is scoped per agent. When `main`'s consolidation runs, it queries only `agent_id = "main"` notes. When `dev`'s consolidation runs (if `dev` has its own consolidation schedule), it queries only `agent_id = "dev"` notes.

### Shared notes are excluded

Notes with `agent_id = "shared"` are explicitly excluded from all agents' consolidation passes. This is intentional:

1. **Ownership ambiguity** — Shared notes may have been written by `main` but are consumed by `dev`. Letting `dev`'s consolidation merge or modify them would violate the `owner` guarantee.
2. **Stability** — Shared notes are intended to be stable reference facts. Automatic merging of shared notes by any agent could corrupt or silently alter information that other agents depend on.
3. **writers enforcement (future)** — When Story 33 implements `writers` field enforcement, only the `owner` agent will be able to modify shared notes. Until then, excluding shared notes from consolidation provides equivalent protection.

### What consolidation does with each scope

| Note type | Included in consolidation? | Why |
|-----------|---------------------------|-----|
| Private (`agent_id = self`) | ✅ Yes | Normal dedup and merge |
| Shared (`agent_id = "shared"`) | ❌ No | Excluded to prevent cross-agent modification |
| Other agent's private notes | ❌ No | Filtered out by `agent_id` query |

## Access fields reference

### Full combination table

| `owner` | `readers` | `writers` | `agent_id` | Meaning |
|---------|-----------|-----------|------------|---------|
| `"main"` | `["main"]` | `["main"]` | `"main"` | Private note written by `main`, readable only by `main` |
| `"dev"` | `["dev"]` | `["dev"]` | `"dev"` | Private note written by `dev`, readable only by `dev` |
| `"main"` | `["*"]` | `["main"]` | `"shared"` | Shared note written by `main`, readable by all agents |
| `"dev"` | `["*"]` | `["dev"]` | `"shared"` | Shared note written by `dev`, readable by all agents |
| `"main"` | `["main", "dev"]` | `["main"]` | `"main"` | Fine-grained ACL (future, not yet implemented) |

### Current enforcement status

| Field | Enforced? | Since | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|-------|
| `owner` | ✅ Schema | Story 32 | Set at write time, not modifiable |
| `readers` | ✅ Query filter | Story 32 | `agent_id IN [self, "shared"]` filter applied to all searches |
| `writers` | ❌ Schema only | Story 32 | Stored in Qdrant but not checked at write/update/delete time |

`writers` enforcement is planned for Story 33. When implemented, any write/evolve/delete operation against a note will first check that the calling agent appears in the note's `writers` list.

## Comparison with mem0 scope model

### mem0's four-dimensional scope

mem0 ([arXiv:2504.19413], ECAI 2025) defines memory scope across four orthogonal dimensions:

| Dimension | Purpose | amem equivalent |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| `user_id` | Separate memories by human user | Not implemented (single-user local) |
| `agent_id` | Separate memories by AI agent | ✅ `agent_id` field |
| `run_id` | Separate memories by conversation/session | Not implemented (single-session local) |
| `app_id` | Separate memories by application | Not implemented (single-app) |

### Why amem doesn't need `run_id` and `app_id`

amem is a **single-user local** system. There is no multi-tenant SaaS context where multiple users or applications share one memory store. Therefore:

- `user_id` — unnecessary; amem assumes a single human operator
- `run_id` — unnecessary; amem treats the OpenClaw session as a continuous context, not isolated conversation runs. Consolidation already handles cross-session memory management.
- `app_id` — unnecessary; amem is a dedicated plugin for OpenClaw only

`user_id` is in the long-term roadmap, to be implemented alongside an HTTP API layer for potential multi-user setups. It will require minimal changes — adding a `user_id` payload filter to Qdrant queries.

### Why explicit shared marker over mem0's implicit null-scoping

mem0's convention: omitting `agent_id` from a memory entry makes it accessible to all agents (implicit shared).

amem's convention: `agent_id="shared"` is an explicit opt-in (explicit shared).

**The problem with implicit null-scoping:**
- A bug that forgets to set `agent_id` accidentally creates a shared (and therefore leaky) memory
- You cannot distinguish "shared by design" from "shared by accident" in the database
- Auditing shared notes requires querying for null/missing `agent_id`, which is awkward in Qdrant

**amem's explicit marker:**
- `grep agent_id:shared` or `filter: { key: "agent_id", match: { value: "shared" } }` gives a clean audit list
- Missing `agent_id` is a write error or treated as private — never accidentally shared
- Per [arXiv:2604.16548]: isolation-by-default, sharing is an explicit, auditable exception

### Computer architecture analogy

[arXiv:2603.10062] frames multi-agent memory as a computer memory hierarchy:

| Architecture level | amem mapping | Visibility |
|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| L1 cache (per-core private) | Private notes (`agent_id = self`) | Only the owning agent |
| RAM (shared) | Shared notes (`agent_id = "shared"`) | All agents |
| NUMA (distributed) | Mode B dedicated collections | Isolated, no cross-agent access |

Mode A implements the L1/RAM split: each agent has a private working set with a global shared region. Mode B implements NUMA-style isolation: each agent has its own address space with no shared region.

---

## Security considerations

### Memory leakage in multi-agent systems

[arXiv:2604.16548] identifies three primary memory leakage vectors in multi-agent LLM systems:

1. **Cross-agent reads** — Agent B reads Agent A's private notes via a shared memory store
2. **Shared memory poisoning** — A malicious or compromised agent writes adversarial content to the shared scope, affecting other agents' retrieval
3. **Consolidation spillover** — An agent's consolidation pass accidentally modifies another agent's notes

openclaw-amem addresses all three:

1. **Cross-agent reads** — `agent_id` filter at query time prevents Agent B from reading Agent A's private notes. In Mode B, separate collections provide physical isolation.
2. **Shared memory poisoning** — Currently mitigated by the quality gate (content < 10 chars rejected, ephemeral flagging). Future Story 33 `writers` enforcement will prevent unauthorized modification of shared notes.
3. **Consolidation spillover** — Consolidation is scoped per agent; shared notes are excluded entirely.

### Isolation-by-default principle

The core security principle, per [arXiv:2604.16548]: **isolation should be the default, sharing is an explicit exception**.

This principle shapes every design decision in openclaw-amem's isolation model:
- Private is the default note scope (no extra config needed)
- Shared requires explicit `agent_id="shared"` (opt-in)
- Consolidation excludes shared notes (conservative default)
- `writers` enforcement is planned (progressive hardening)

### What is NOT yet protected

- **`writers` enforcement** — Story 32 stores the `writers` field but does not enforce it. A `dev` agent could technically evolve or soft-delete a shared note written by `main`. Story 33 will add a hard check.
- **Prompt injection via shared notes** — A compromised agent could write adversarial content into a shared note that manipulates another agent's behavior when retrieved. This is a known attack class ([arXiv:2604.16548] §4). Mitigation requires content validation at write time (future work).

---

## Limitations and future work

### Story 33: `writers` enforcement

The `writers` field is currently schema-only. When Story 33 is implemented:

- Any `updateMemory`, `evolveNote`, or `softDelete` call will first check `writers` includes the calling agent
- Write attempts by unauthorized agents will return a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error
- The consolidation loop will double-check `writers` before merging shared notes

### No cross-collection sharing in Mode B

In Mode B, each agent operates on its own dedicated Qdrant collection. There is no cross-collection query mechanism. If `main` writes a shared note in `amem_notes` and `dev` is in Mode B (`amem_notes_dev`), `dev` does not see `main`'s shared note.

This is a deliberate trade-off: Mode B prioritizes physical isolation over sharing convenience. If you need cross-agent sharing, use Mode A.

### No fine-grained ACL beyond binary private/shared

Current `readers` options are:
- `["<agentId>"]` — private (single agent)
- `["*"]` — shared (all agents)

A future fine-grained ACL (`readers: ["main", "dev"]` for selective sharing between specific agents) is possible without schema changes — only query filter logic would need updating. This is planned post-Story 33.

### `user_id` dimension

amem is currently single-user. A `user_id` dimension is planned alongside an HTTP API layer for potential multi-user deployments. When added, it will be an additional Qdrant payload filter with no breaking changes to the existing `agent_id` isolation model.
